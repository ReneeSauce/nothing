			i envy the trees
			<br>
			their way of life
			<br>
			ˈnʌθɪŋ to do
			<br>
			but wait for the sun
			<br>
			no one does ˈnʌθɪŋ
			<br>
			better than the trees
			<br>
			<br>
			but these unnatural trees
			<br>
			grow not as they please
			<br>
			in these suburbs and cities
			<br>
			confined to a grid
			<br>
			designed by comittee
			<br>
			hopeless nature simulators
			<br>
			<br>
			still in these trees
			<br>
			there is love to be found
			<br>
			a lesson to learn
			<br>
			please teach me to plant
			<br>
			my own roots in the ground
			<br>
			<br>
			i want to climb the tallest tree
			<br>
			in the city of trees
			<br>
			and kiss her leaves
			<br>
			and feel the breeze
			<br>
			and let her branches tickle me
			<br>
			<br>
			i could do ˈnʌθɪŋ with you
			<br>
			all day my love dream
			<br>
			through the night with you
			<br>
			and wait for the sun
