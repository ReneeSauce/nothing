			the train from iowa to california takes roughly two-and-a-half days. given no wifi, the brain grows anxious doing ˈnʌθɪŋ. since the average train posture is sitting, calorie intake is decreased. a cup of coffee in the morning and a pre-packaged microwavable hotdog is ample sustenance for the belly of the <em>homosedens</em>. however, by the end of the second day the body will be acutely aware of the lack of fresh fruit and vegetables. bring a bag of clementines. learn to peel them in a single continuous peel. always keep learning. have a conversation with a stranger. read a book, front to back. the number of books may vary depending on the level of tolerance to human interaction. remember to relax. it is very important to keep the brain, the belly, and the body satisfied. if one should suffer, then so shall the other two. ˈnʌθɪŋ is more important but all three are rarely satisfied with ˈnʌθɪŋ. but they all love sugar. they are addicted to sugar.
			<br><br>
			besides ˈnʌθɪŋ, there is little else to do on a train but watch trees. the number of trees is mind-bogglingly big. almost uncountable. in fact, there are more trees in colorado than humans on the earth. the notion that all the trees have been counted provides no comfort; it merely suggests every tree is under the military protection of some bureaucratic state or federal government. the idea of nature as human property is undeniably eerie. because of this eeriness, and perhaps guilt over the decimation of nature, there is a rising interest in owning and caring for miniature potted plants. various arrays and arrangements of succulents in every american household, reminiscent of the popularity of bonsai trees. the succulescence is an ambiguous omen: for better or for worse, american pop culture is sick of worshiping itself. the succulent is the new <em>objet d'art</em> of the leisure class. i see your mezuzah on the door, yes, and your cross on the wall, indeed, and your pride flag, but are you really fulfilling your humanly duties without your aloe vera? the succulent is the fetish of the future; focus on your ficus and the ruling class will take care of the rest. nature as escapism is ˈnʌθɪŋ new, but the forces of consumerism have somehow, in the household plant, perfected the shape and form of inhuman cuteness. the result is uncanny. every kitchen a kitschy garden of eden. the apollonian eyes have turned their gaze away from the human form and back toward chthonian nature as cute consumerist cactus. hopefully we can break through the facade and return to true nature. man may count the trees and capture its leaves but man cannot conquer his desire for the earth whose botanical works of art it grows from ˈnʌθɪŋ. man's mastery of nature's mysteries will only convince him to tear his simulation down. the human desire to connect must submit to nature. if trains survive in the new plantocracy, they will be for the speedy worship of the forest.

			the book i read on the train was bronze age mindset. published in 2018, it offers insight into the mind of the adolescent male in the late information age. bronze age pervert, the author, is a russian internet troll and his book is politically incorrect, deliberately offensive, and remarkably persuasive. therefore, read with caution as this book may leave you with the urge to storm the capitol. it is rife with misogyny, anti-semitism, transphobia, and a special mention of the ugliness of tagalog. i am, admittedly, not the intended demographic; in the bronze age vernacular, i am trapwoman descended from nerdish jews and impish filipinos. actually, this makes me the perfect demographic. in fact, bronze age pervert and i have similar interests. also, he uses ˈnʌθɪŋ fifty-five times, almost once every 4 pages, but who's counting? i am, of course. camille paglia and friedrich nietzsche are his most frequent name-drops, and his ideas are clearly influenced by nietzsche's übermensch and the will to power as well as paglia's analysis of western culture as a tension between the apollonian and the dionysian. bronze age pervert himself falls neatly in line with the homoerotic aesthetes studied by paglia. bronze age mindset is 4chan greentext as decadent romantic poetry and bronze age pervert is dionysus jealous of apollo. neo-romanticist because nostalgic for the roman empire.  “he is apollonian in his worship of form but romantic in his instinct for the daemonic.” paglia’s description of oscar wilde could very well describe bronze age pervert. he is a dionysian with apollonian ideals. he tells many tales of nightlife, of prostitutes, of drunk fights with strangers. he laments the decline of masculinity and aestheticism. he diagnoses this decline as a symptom of the overextended ownership of the earth. there is ˈnʌθɪŋ left to own. there is no liberty, not even in the criminal underworld where bronze age pervert prefers to spend his time. “it is with sadness," he laments "that you realize, eventually, after the first exhilarating rush of freedom in this world of the damned, that these spaces too, though not so pervasively ‘owned,’ have portals and gates manned by that which owns everything else. still, it’s better than ˈnʌθɪŋ because in the moment all of that’s still far away…”. this recalls the later seasons of breaking bad, where the fried chicken industry and the meth industry are managed by the same person. human as animal can detect when the space it occupies is already owned. furthermore, “this intuition of owned space comes on one very early: with eyes open, it’s like an evil spirit inhabits everything.” here, i agree with bronze age pervert. as early as the classroom is the child aware of the unnatural oppression of civilization. bronze age pervert argues that reproduction as an end in itself, the dionysian love of life, is self-destructive. he compares the abundance of human beings to the mindless growth of yeast and blames the unhappiness of overpopulation on the 'gynocracy'. he writes, “the communal life of the longhouse with its young men dominated and broken by the old and sclerotic, by the matriarchs, the blob and yeast mode in human life overtaking and subjecting all higher aspiration. ” man, neutered by woman, becomes her impotent house cat. i sometimes sense in my cat, Jamie, a deep sadness and i wonder if he knows he is the property of decadent lesbians. still, he watches over us at night, like a eunuch eager to protect and serve his queens.

			so, what is the bronze age mindset and for whom is this book intended? the bronze age mindset glorifies war and violence as the ultimate means to an end of perfection and beauty; war refines the human body and reshapes it into the apollonian form. war alone, with fists and swords, will deliver us the band of beautiful superhumans with sculpted bodies worthy of our worship. it is ultimately a rally cry to the disillusioned and lonely young men, who flock to internet fora to seek their communion, for them to unite and physically reclaim a space in which to master their abilities and become übermenschen. i agree with bronze age pervert that men need a place to escape from the women and women need the same thing. with men always at war, who is left to keep the home and raise the children? man's everlasting war against the matriarchy is a self-fulfilling prophecy. the devotion to form and beauty will only lead to surface-level engagement. pure aestheticism, having no moral foundation, is threatened by nihilism. men want to fight but they need something to fight for. at sarah lawrence college, notorious girl school, a group of men did start a fight club in 2017 but it was soon shut down by administration. that same year at sarah lawrence, a group of mostly women went beyond administrative authority to establish a sexual panopticon. feminist society is too unkind to fraternity because, unfortunately, boys <em>will</em> be boys. testosterone is a hell of a drug. a boy in isolation, however, is emasculated. boys are no match for the cunning brilliance of a group of girls. bronze age pervert believes men can overcome their melancholy state through developing their unbreakable bonds and he is hopeful that the spiritual reincarnations of alexander the great and hephaestion will emerge and conquer the earth through their genuine friendship. this reminds me a little too much of my little pony. i’m sure many of bronze age pervert's intended readers have already learned that friendship is magic and magic is power. my little pervert makes a compelling case, however, commanding men to “band with your friends on the way of power and know that ˈnʌθɪŋ has the right to stop you, and ˈnʌθɪŋ can stop you!”. i, too, felt the command to fulfill some eternal societal role deep within me. an ancient spirit in a new body. i was most likely one of those transvestite shamans in a past life, highly-critical of the status quo, who bit the dick off the hunters with too much bravado. i have my cock and eat it too. the bronze age mindset has a blindspot to which men and women are both vulnerable: cuteness.
			<br><br>
			 masculinity and femininity are ideals of the human form and, being all too human, are terms of antiquity in the postmodern era of object-oriented ontology. cuteness and toughness, the desexed abstractions of femininity and masculinity, are the new ideals. you can't tell a child to 'man up', but you can tell them to 'be tough'. outdated adjectives such as 'pretty', 'beautiful', and 'handsome' must be replaced with the all encompassing 'cute'. humanity itself has been neutered by cuteness. the age of cuteness is edging over the horizon from across the pacific ocean. consider the popularity of emoji; this kawaii pictographic lexicon is slowly becoming a global language, especially among youth. zoomers feel more inclined to send a heart emoji than to say 'i love you'. cuteness is internationally understood, and it sells. disney studios, lego, cocomelon are all very well versed in the art of cuteness and visual sugar. bronze age pervert is misguided when he blames his woes on feminism; consumerism is the true enemy and cuteness its greatest weapon. cuteness pacifies the human mind. apollonian thinking outpaces humanities own abilities; technology can only take us so far so quickly. the train from iowa to california takes no shorter than two-and-a-half days. with so much time and very little progress, the people need to be entertained. bronze age pervert wants to start from scratch and let perfection of the human form reemerge as the ultimate end. however, this will only lead to the bastardized simulation of nature once again. with all of space already owned, the only frontier left is time. can the bronze age mindset reclaim the future? consumerism would like to convince you that the future is already laid out; ˈnʌθɪŋ is required of you but to pick a brand and be satisfied. i say be satisfied with ˈnʌθɪŋ. if the masses can learn to accept ˈnʌθɪŋ from the ruling class then the ruling class will have no power over them. this is the only way to disrupt the status quo. be upfront about doing ˈnʌθɪŋ. consumerism presents a deceptive simulation of nature; chthonian in its magical production of new brands and apollonian in its mechanical reproduction of the brand. as bronze age pervert puts it, “the modern is 'ˈnʌθɪŋ new': it is the return of a very ancient subjection and brokenness under new branding, promoted by new concepts and justifications.” when my girlfriend and i go grocery shopping we often find ourselves in the candy aisle, staring at a plethora of options. why do we need more than fifty different concoctions of sugar and chocolate? why do they all have adorable mascots? these candies are made for children but consumerist ideology follows into adulthood. it is ultimately adults, especially women, who are the most vulnerable to consumerism. i propose the love of ˈnʌθɪŋ as the only weapon against our loss of humanity. ˈnʌθɪŋ will remind you of what is most human: the fear of ˈnʌθɪŋ. ˈnʌθɪŋ is the cause of the impotent rage of today's youth. ˈnʌθɪŋ to own, ˈnʌθɪŋ to do, ˈnʌθɪŋ to leave behind. a history of ˈnʌθɪŋ, a new dark age, is our greatest fear. we must come face to face with ˈnʌθɪŋ and together overcome it. we must confront the chaotic and chthonian ˈnʌθɪŋ.
