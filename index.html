			what is ˈnʌθɪŋ? where did ˈnʌθɪŋ come from? does ˈnʌθɪŋ really exist? the greek philosopher parmenides, of the 5th century b.c.e., says no. to know ˈnʌθɪŋ exists would be an ontological and epistemological paradox. thus we lose ˈnʌθɪŋ as a justifiable concept. i, however, reject this tradition of making ˈnʌθɪŋ out of ˈnʌθɪŋ. to say ˈnʌθɪŋ is inconceivable is to erase it as the primary motivating factor for the perpetual continuation of life and intelligence. the freedom to know ˈnʌθɪŋ, do ˈnʌθɪŋ, want ˈnʌθɪŋ is the infinite freedom to choose from anything and everything. but mind you this: ˈnʌθɪŋ is as obscure in the mind as anything and everything. ˈnʌθɪŋ is almighty in its obscurity but this should not discourage one from pursuing the conception of ˈnʌθɪŋ. at the risk of playing god, let's make something out of ˈnʌθɪŋ.
			<br><br>
			ˈnʌθɪŋ is a versatile and volatile substance. ˈnʌθɪŋ must be contained before it can be manipulated. the container comes in many forms. for one, there is the number zero. for the set theorists, there is the empty set {} or ∅. in english there is a word of seven letters and the sound it makes, contained in these symbols: ˈnʌθɪŋ. all these a metaphor for the elusive ˈnʌθɪŋ. the symbolic container is not ˈnʌθɪŋ, it is a tool whose behavior is almost exactly what we expect of ˈnʌθɪŋ. the container is ˈnʌθɪŋ incorporate, organized into a body where true ˈnʌθɪŋ is an organless body. ˈnʌθɪŋ is the chthonian, chaotic and uncontainable. the container is something we can count on, literally; the axiom of containment permits a mapping from sets to natural numbers, where the empty set maps to 0 and the set containing the empty set maps to 1, and the set containing the two previous sets maps to 2, and so on, in theory. in reality, spacetime and energy are finite and reserved for rational numbers. all others are alluded to or erased altogether. ˈnʌθɪŋ by lack of memory. the square root of 2, and all other irrationals, must be put to death. the force of enumeration, the power of infinite ˈnʌθɪŋ to count and collect, requires an equal force of execution, the power of finite ˈnʌθɪŋ to reduce and refine. infinity is as impractical as ˈnʌθɪŋ. with one always looking ahead toward infinity, ˈnʌθɪŋ creeps up from behind. ˈnʌθɪŋ has the power to invoke one and infinity. it is no wonder mathematicians don't take ˈnʌθɪŋ for granted.
			<br><br>
			ˈnʌθɪŋ appears in the west as vile enemy. the devil in disguise, from which evil flows into man. turn away from ˈnʌθɪŋ and turn toward the infinite goodness of the true one. it is the manifest destiny of the west to leave no stone or soul unturned. the progressive will to knowledge and the conservative will to authority combine into powers of enumeration and execution. ˈnʌθɪŋ, the true source of power, is cruelly hidden; deemed regressive. have ˈnʌθɪŋz, doˈnʌθɪŋz, and know ˈnʌθɪŋz must be avoided by all means. people made into ˈnʌθɪŋ by power of execution, delegitimation, and historical omission. the modern era dies with the end of the holocaust and the release of the atom bomb, pinnacles of executive and enumerative power. the space age could not survive because of its rapid consumption. information about the physical world comes at a cost. the west does not have enough resources to both obtain the information it wants and sustain its population control. in the information age, energy is diverted from acquisition to organization. managerialism takes precedence over capitalism. structure takes precedence over value. physical information is slowly translated into virtual information. the physical world starts to resemble the virtual world. the western brain, futile in its attempt to escape its terrestrial body, attempts to escape its physical body. in the postmodern era, new structures are quickly populated with endless variations. self and self-reference, experience and simulation, are indistinguishable. true and false are interchangeable. ˈnʌθɪŋ has inherent value. buddha and nietzsche roll in their graves. avoiding ˈnʌθɪŋ is what the west did best. now the ghost of ˈnʌθɪŋ haunts them. the east is more at ease with ghosts, and it may mean the downfall of the west. as their global merge accelerates, the world will be pushed into a ghost-modern era, an age of ˈnʌθɪŋ.
			<br><br>
			the first generation of the age of ˈnʌθɪŋ was born alongside the telecommunications act of 1996. generation z were allowed unrestricted access to unregulated information. today, generation z struggle to escape a state of overstimulation. meanwhile, the distribution of sanitized information has been slowly streamlined, reaching a peak during the pandemic, transforming education into a click-and-drag, pay-to-play video game. very little if not ˈnʌθɪŋ is expected of our students, from kindergartner to college senior. in return, generation z and proceeding generations expect very little if not ˈnʌθɪŋ from society. professional employment fails to relieve student debt, housing is inaccessible, and, in a few years, health will be irrelevant since global climate change might extinguish the human race. we have ˈnʌθɪŋ, know ˈnʌθɪŋ, do ˈnʌθɪŋ, because what we do wont matter, what we know is uncertain, what we have we pay for through subscription. apathy and antipathy is our plague. we are left with ˈnʌθɪŋ; less than ˈnʌθɪŋ. in the ghost-modern era, when we die we die with debt. unfinished business to haunt the living.
			<br><br>
			we live in a simulation of efficient people management. choice and self expression is dictated by social media. to not post is to fade into ˈnʌθɪŋ. notifications tell us when to stay home; when we go out, choice is limited. coke or pepsi? i choose ˈnʌθɪŋ. i am a prophet of ˈnʌθɪŋ. i see ˈnʌθɪŋ. i hear ˈnʌθɪŋ. i speak of ˈnʌθɪŋ with the utmost sincerity. ˈnʌθɪŋ is more than mere language game. i propose ˈnʌθɪŋ of great value. ˈnʌθɪŋ worthy of belief. ˈnʌθɪŋ to fear and worship. ˈnʌθɪŋ so awesome in its capability of both creation and destruction. ˈnʌθɪŋ has the power to reverse the flow of entropy. ˈnʌθɪŋ will remind us of what we love and hate most. ˈnʌθɪŋ to illuminate us against the shroud of simulation.
